# SDL2-Gamepad-Example
Just an example for how a person can use SDL2's Gamepad API. The example wraps the API into a class that is similar in structure to 
the "Windows.Gaming.Input" library, and the class itself is in it's own header file named "sdl_gamepad.h". If you want to use sdl_gamepad.h 
directly or modify it in any way for your own projects, feel free to do so!
