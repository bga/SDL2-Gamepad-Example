# SDL2-Gamepad-Example
Just an example for how a person can use SDL2's Gamepad API. The example wraps the API into a class that is similar in structure to 
the "Windows.Gaming.Input" library, and the class itself is in it's own header file named "sdl_gamepad.h". If you want to use sdl_gamepad.h 
directly or modify it in any way for your own projects, feel free to do so! I tried to make it as seamless as possible in use, and the "Test" app
serves to also act as an example for using as much of SDL2's Gamepad functionality with code that would be structured in a production way.
